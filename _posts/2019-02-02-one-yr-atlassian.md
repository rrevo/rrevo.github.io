I’ve been working at [Atlassian Mountian View](https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers/mountain-view) for slightly over a year now. It’s a good time for some reflection then. I passed over the acronym chasm and feel pretty familiar with most systems now. But I’m still absorbing a lot of new stuff.. so not yet an insider.

Here are some of the main points that stand out-

## Growth

The Access team and product have grown immensely. From a few individuals we've grown to a multi-displine team that has been tackling hard problems.  It does get a bit chaotic at times.. but that's part of the growth experience. And a major reason for us doing well is the massive support from other teams and ecosystem.

## Values

I’ve worked in quite a few companies around the world. Atlassian is one of the few places where the [company values](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values) do make sense… but more importantly I do see them being applied in day to day interactions.

We are very transparent and open … that took me some time to get used to. But now it just seems obvious.

## Culture

Within Access, we are obsessed about shipping. Not ship fast and break things, ship quality stuff fast. Leadership accepts experimentation, deferring on scope which helps! We truly believe in shipping and getting feedback.. and then improving further.

We are DO-ers!

## Going forward

We absolutely need to continue and accelerate on a lot of things that we are doing right.

We still need to mature - in processes, and systems... especially as we grow. The downside of fast paced growth is that we do leave some loose ends open. 

## Other trivia

* One trip to Australia  
* I’m on my third macbook pro since joining. The touchbar mbp’s are really really flaky. I carry a usb → usb-c dongle at all times. Thanks Apple.
* As my kids celebrated their 100th day in kindergarten, I’m amazed that we’ve managed avoiding a single tardy slip
