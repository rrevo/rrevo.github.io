# Kiva

[Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/) is a non-profit lending platform that connects lenders and borrowers across the world.

While browsing their website I did notice a stark difference in profiles of borrowers from America vs India. Can you spot the difference below?

![Americans]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/happy-people.png)

![Indians]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/sad-people.png)

All the lenders above are entrepreneurs. Although absolute monetary value of the loan asked is different, adjusted for cost of living, I think values are similar.

However the Americans have been asked to look enterprising and optimistic. While the Indian profiles look destitute.

Some possible reasons for this could be-
* Active A/B test that shows that such profiles generate better lending rates for all regions since most lenders are from America.
* Invalid assumption that this sells.
* Good old-fashioned colonialism. It can be either kiva or some local partner that promotes this.

# Happy India

Indian culture is different from American culture. While India is poorer per-capita, I'm confident that the population is much happier then what an outsider would assume.

[Shantaram](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33600.Shantaram) was a book by an Australian who ends up living in India in the slums of Bombay. Now that's a life that even I've not lived. One of the most interesting parts of the book is how happy the people are inspite of the conditions. Some of the reasons for this are a deeper sense of community and belonging.


# Poverty Stats

I'm optimistic about the future. I've lived for a significant amount of time in both America and India and see the raw spirit of both populations to succeed. Historically India has had a lot of poverty but the situation is improving. Global poverty rates are [reducing](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Max-Roser-three-facts-everyone-should-know) of which India is surely a significant contributor.

Some day these profiles will show a better representation of Indians closer to who they truly are. And a large part of that change will also require Indians helping each other more by way of philanthropy.

PS There is a [Happy Planet Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Planet_Index) and India fares better than America
