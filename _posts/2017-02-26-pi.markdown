Programming a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) is fun. I've built some simple program's operating LED's but there is a different joy when seeing a physical interaction due to a program. It's even more exciting when your kids see police car lights in 3 blinking LED's.

Here are some references for getting started with a Pi

* Reformat a new image on the SD card - <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md>
* Setup Wifi - <http://weworkweplay.com/play/automatically-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-wifi-network/>
* Update OS - <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md>
* Setup password-less ssh access

Finally Hack away!
