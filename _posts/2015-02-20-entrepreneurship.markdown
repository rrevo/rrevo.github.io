Entrepreneurship [101](https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x) and [102](https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-102-what-can-you-do-mitx-15-390-2x) are MOOC courses by MIT that intend to *teach Entrepreneurship*.

The courses cover two primary sections from the book [Disciplined Entrepreneurship: 24 steps to a successful startup](http://goo.gl/DjuM4n) -

* 101 - Who is your customer? (blue section)
* 102 - What can you do for your customer? (red section)

I am working my way through the 101 course right now. In the past I've made *attempts* at starting a business and failed for various reasons. Because of my engineering mindset, I've always wanted to jump directly into implementing a solution without necessarily thinking about the viability of the business. The book and the course are especially pertinent to me for this reason.

### Myths

Some of the myths about entrepreneurship that are debunked are-

* Entrepreneurs are born not made - Teaching the process is the aim of the course.
* Individuals start companies - (Diverse) Teams start companies. I've not been able to get more people involved in my earlier ventures.
* Smartest people start companies - Focussed & dedicated people are needed.
* Charismatic - Vision, Systematic thinking, Strong analytical skills, Humility and Ambition and Disciplined execution skills.
* Love risk - Calculated risk is the key.
* Undisciplined - In fact need great execution skills.

### 101 goals

In the first course, the goal is to figure out who the customer is. Some of the key points mentioned are-

* Getting paying customers is a necessity
* Brainstorm ideas and then narrow to a beachhead market where you can start the *attack*.
* Talk to people and figure out their pain points.
* Focus is emphasized multiple times because at the start a team has very limited bandwidth.
* Figuring out the [TAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market).
* Build an end-user profile and persona. This will help maintain focus on who the customer is.

### Conclusion

The course and book definitely add a lot of structure to the process of starting a business. It helps understanding areas of risk and the importance of focus. The assignments also involve *field work* of going out and talking to real people, potential customers.

Now the only thing that remains is actually following the steps and starting a business!
