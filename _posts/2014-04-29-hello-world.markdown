Hello World! I've been blogging occasionally on [codeword](http://codeword.blogspot.com) but have not been as regular as I would like. So time to make another start.

What are some of the things that I have been busy with?

* Micro Services, architecture and design
* Spring, JPA, messaging, REST, Git, multiple editors and IDEs
* Parenting
* Home maintenance

I'll be writing on these topics and much more.
